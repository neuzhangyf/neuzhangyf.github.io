I am a professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [Northeastern University](https://neu.edu.cn/), China. I received my B.A., M.S., and Ph.D. from Northeastern University, China, in 2005, 2008, and 2012 respectively. During my Ph. D. study, I spent ~3 years working in Multimedia Networking & Internet Lab at University of Massachusetts Amherst as a visiting Ph.D. student. I am leading [iDC-NEU Group](https://idc-neu.github.io).

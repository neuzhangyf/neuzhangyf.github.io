I am a professor at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.neu.edu.cn/) at [Northeastern University](https://neu.edu.cn/), China. I received my B.A., M.S., and Ph.D. from Northeastern University, China, in 2005, 2008, and 2012 respectively. During my Ph. D. study, I spent ~3 years working in [Multimedia Networking & Internet Lab](http://rio.ecs.umass.edu/) at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) as a visiting Ph.D. student working under the supervision of [Prof. Lixin Gao](https://infosec.cs.umass.edu/person/gao-lixin). I visited [Prof. Xiaodong Zhang](https://cse.osu.edu/people/zhang.574)'s group at the [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) from Dec. 2016 to Dec. 2017.

My research interests include database systems, machine learning systems, and graph computing systems.

I am leading [iDC-NEU Group](https://idc-neu.github.io) at Northeastern University, China.
